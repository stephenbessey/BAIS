# BAIS Platform Security Runbook

## Overview
This runbook provides operational security procedures for the BAIS platform, covering incident response, key management, monitoring, and compliance.

## Security Incident Response

### 1. Incident Detection
- Monitor `/var/log/bais/security_audit.log` for violations
- Watch for rate limit alerts and failed authentication patterns
- Check system monitoring dashboards for anomalies

### 2. Immediate Actions
```bash
# Block suspicious IP address
iptables -A INPUT -s <IP_ADDRESS> -j DROP

# Revoke compromised tokens
python scripts/revoke_tokens.py --user <USER_ID>

# Lock user account
python scripts/lock_account.py --user <USER_ID>

# Restart affected services
systemctl restart bais-api
```

### 3. Investigation Procedures
```bash
# Review audit logs
grep "security_violation" /var/log/bais/security_audit.log | tail -100

# Check payment activity
grep "payment_" /var/log/bais/security_audit.log | grep <USER_ID>

# Review mandate activity
grep "mandate_" /var/log/bais/security_audit.log | grep <USER_ID>

# Analyze authentication failures
grep "auth_failure" /var/log/bais/security_audit.log | tail -50
```

### 4. Remediation Steps
1. **Rotate compromised keys** immediately
2. **Force password reset** for affected users
3. **Revoke active sessions** and tokens
4. **Update firewall rules** if needed
5. **Notify stakeholders** as per incident response plan

### 5. Post-Incident Actions
- Document incident in security log
- Update security policies and procedures
- Conduct team debrief and lessons learned
- Implement preventive measures

## Key Management Procedures

### JWT Secret Rotation
```bash
# 1. Generate new secret
NEW_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 64)

# 2. Update environment variable
export JWT_SECRET_KEY=$NEW_SECRET

# 3. Restart application
systemctl restart bais-api

# 4. Revoke all existing tokens
python scripts/revoke_all_tokens.py
```

### AP2 Key Pair Rotation
```bash
# 1. Generate new key pair
python scripts/generate_ap2_keys.py --output keys/ap2_new

# 2. Update AP2 network with new public key
curl -X POST https://ap2-network.example.com/keys/update \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AP2_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"public_key": "$(cat keys/ap2_new_public.pem)"}'

# 3. Update environment variables
export AP2_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat keys/ap2_new_private.pem)
export AP2_PUBLIC_KEY=$(cat keys/ap2_new_public.pem)

# 4. Restart application
systemctl restart bais-api
```
