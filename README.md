## Overview

The Business-Agent Integration Standard (BAIS) Enterprise Platform is a production-grade business automation system that enables standardized AI agent interactions with enterprise services. This platform implements Google's A2A protocol and Anthropic's Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) to provide secure, scalable agent-to-business integration.

## Business Solution

Our platform solves critical enterprise challenges in AI agent integration by providing:

- **Standardized Business APIs**: Unified protocols for hotel bookings, restaurant reservations, and e-commerce transactions
- **Enterprise Security**: OAuth 2.0, mandate verification, and comprehensive audit logging
- **Scalable Architecture**: Production-ready infrastructure supporting high-volume agent interactions
- **Payment Integration**: Seamless AP2 payment workflows with mandate-based authorization
