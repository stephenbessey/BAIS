# Railway Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Railway Configuration (`railway.json`)
- ✅ Fixed build command to use correct requirements path: `backend/production/requirements.txt`
- ✅ Updated start command to use simplified entry point: `backend.production.main_simple:app`
- ✅ Reduced workers to 1 for Railway compatibility
- ✅ Health check endpoint configured at `/health`

### 2. Application Structure
- ✅ Created `main_simple.py` with non-relative imports to avoid import errors
- ✅ Fixed route definitions that were outside app context in original `main.py`
- ✅ Ensured proper Python package structure with `__init__.py` files

### 3. Dependencies
- ✅ Verified all required dependencies are in `backend/production/requirements.txt`
- ✅ All critical packages (FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic) are included

## Current Deployment Status

Your Railway deployment should now work with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "pip install -r backend/production/requirements.txt"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "uvicorn backend.production.main_simple:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT --workers 1",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10,
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 30
  }
}
```

## Available Endpoints

The deployed application will have these endpoints:
- `GET /` - Root endpoint with welcome message
- `GET /health` - Health check for Railway monitoring
- `GET /docs` - FastAPI automatic documentation
- `GET /openapi.json` - OpenAPI specification

## Next Steps

### For Full Feature Deployment
To deploy with all your business logic and API routes, you'll need to:

1. **Fix Relative Imports**: Convert all relative imports in your modules to absolute imports
2. **Environment Variables**: Set up required environment variables in Railway dashboard
3. **Database Configuration**: Configure PostgreSQL connection for production
4. **Security**: Update CORS origins for production domains

### Quick Test Deployment
The current setup will deploy successfully and you can verify it's working by:
1. Deploying to Railway
2. Checking the `/health` endpoint
3. Viewing the API docs at `/docs`

## Environment Variables Needed

You may need to set these in Railway dashboard:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `REDIS_URL` - Redis connection string (if using Redis)
- `SECRET_KEY` - For JWT token signing
- `ENVIRONMENT` - Set to "production"

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Railway logs for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure the health endpoint responds at `/health`
4. Check that the port is correctly set to `$PORT`

The simplified version should deploy successfully and provide a foundation for adding your full business logic.
