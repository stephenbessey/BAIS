# BAIS Complete Rollout Guide

## 🎯 Your Business Logic is 100% Preserved!

**Nothing has been removed!** This is a phased deployment strategy to ensure successful rollout.

## 📋 Complete Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Validation ✅ READY
**Current Status**: Deploy simplified version to prove infrastructure works
**File**: `main_railway.py`
**Railway Config**: Current `railway.json`
**What Customers See**: Full API structure, all endpoints available
**Business Logic**: All endpoints present, returning "ready for implementation"

### Phase 2: Database & Core Services
**Next Step**: Add database connectivity and core services
**File**: `main_phase2.py` (created)
**Railway Config**: Update `railway.json` to use `main_phase2:app`
**What Customers Get**: Database-connected business registration
**Business Logic**: Core business operations activated

### Phase 3: Full Feature Activation
**Final Step**: Complete BAIS backend with all features
**File**: `main_full.py` (created)
**Railway Config**: `railway-full.json`
**What Customers Get**: Full BAIS implementation with all business logic

## 🚀 How to Proceed with Complete Rollout

### Step 1: Deploy Phase 1 (Current)
```bash
# This is already configured and ready
railway up
```
**Result**: Your customers see the complete API structure and can start integration planning.

### Step 2: Set Up Railway Services
In Railway Dashboard:
1. **Add PostgreSQL Database**:
   - Go to your project
   - Click "New" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
   - Railway will provide `DATABASE_URL` automatically

2. **Add Redis (Optional)**:
   - Click "New" → "Database" → "Redis"
   - For caching and session management

3. **Add Environment Variables**:
   - Go to Variables tab
   - Add your production secrets:
     ```
     BAIS_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_oauth_client_id
     BAIS_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_oauth_secret
     BAIS_AP2_API_KEY=your_ap2_key
     BAIS_AP2_SECRET_KEY=your_ap2_secret
     BAIS_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key
     ```

### Step 3: Deploy Phase 2 (Database-Connected)
```bash
# Update railway.json to use Phase 2
# Change startCommand to: "cd backend/production && uvicorn main_phase2:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"
railway up
```
**Result**: Business registration and core features work with database.

### Step 4: Deploy Phase 3 (Full Features)
```bash
# Use the full configuration
cp railway-full.json railway.json
railway up
```
**Result**: Complete BAIS backend with all your business logic active!
