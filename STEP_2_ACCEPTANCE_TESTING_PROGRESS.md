---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Primary Issue: Authorization Middleware**
Most failing tests are related to the authentication/authorization middleware:
- Tests that require authentication are failing
- Token validation is working but test flow needs adjustment
- Need to ensure test users are properly authenticated before API calls

### **Secondary Issues**
1. **Rate Limiting**: Threshold may be too aggressive for testing
2. **Error Handling**: Need proper 400 status code responses
3. **Cache Operations**: Simulation needs refinement

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps for Full Success**

### **Immediate Actions (Next 30 minutes)**
1. **Fix Authentication Flow**: Ensure test users can authenticate properly
2. **Adjust Rate Limiting**: Optimize for testing environment
3. **Enhance Error Handling**: Add proper validation responses
4. **Refine Cache Operations**: Improve simulation accuracy

### **Expected Outcome**
With these fixes, we expect to achieve:
- **Target Success Rate**: 85-95%
- **All Critical Tests**: User management, payment processing, webhooks
- **Production Readiness**: Validated business logic and infrastructure
